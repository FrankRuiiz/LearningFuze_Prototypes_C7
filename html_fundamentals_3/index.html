        <h1>Welcome To Frank Ruiz's Portfolio Page</h1>

        <h2 id="aboutMeHeader">About Me</h2>
        <p id="aboutMe">Hello may name is Frank and I am an aspiring Web Developer. Back in April 2015 I challenged myself to learn the
            fundamentals of the profession where I used many resources including books, online tutorials, group meet-ups and now
            Learning Fuze! My goal is to gain employment in the field with an organization that would allow me to hone my
            skills. In addition I plan to use these skills in order to test any business ventures/ideas that I may have in the
            future.
        </p>

        <h2 id="skillsHeader">Skills</h2>
        <h3 class="skill">HTML5/CSS3</h3>
        <p>I have a good understanding of the role of HTML and how to use it. I would like to refine my knowledge and use of CSS
            in order to create better looking/structured sites and applications.</p>
        <h3 class="skill">JavaScript/jQuery</h3>
        <p>To be a good web developer, one must have a good grasp of JS. My goal is to understand JS very well so that I can
            also learn other JS frameworks and programming languages.</p>
        <h3 class="skill">Back End Programming</h3>
        <p>I have not really studied much back end programming. I hope to build a solid understanding of PHP in this program. In
            the future I would like to learn more about server side programming with JS.</p>

        <h2 id="experienceHeader">Experience</h2>
        <p class="greenBackground">I graduated from Cal Poly Pomona with a BS in Business Administration in 2011. Since then I have had several jobs
            where I was working in departments such as customer service, marketing, and administration. I did not find meaning
            or any real importance in the work I was doing which seemed to always lead me to leaving and finding something else.
            I am hoping that with this career change into web development and the ability to create things that people will see
            and use I will find more meaning and importance in the work I do (I would also like to be paid a little better
            :).</p>
