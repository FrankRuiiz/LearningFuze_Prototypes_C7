    <h1 style="color: darkslategrey">About Me</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 200%">Hello may name is Frank and I am an aspiring Web Developer.  Back in April 2015 I challenged myself to learn the fundamentals of the profession where I used many resources including books, online tutorials, group meet-ups and now Learning Fuze! My goal is to gain employment in the field with an organization that would allow me to hone my skills.  In addition I plan to use these skills in order to test any business ventures/ideas that I may have in the future.
        </p>

    <h1><i>Skills</i></h1>
        <h3 class="skills">HTML5/CSS3</h3>
            <p>I have a good understanding of the role of HTML and how to use it. I would like to refine my knowledge and use of CSS in order to create better looking/structured sites and applications.</p>
        <h3 class="skills">JavaScript/jQuery</h3>
            <p>To be a good web developer, one must have a good grasp of JS.  My goal is to understand JS very well so that I can also learn other JS frameworks and programming languages.</p>
        <h3 class="skills">Back End Programming</h3>
            <p>I have not really studied much back end programming. I hope to build a solid understanding of PHP in this program. In the future I would like to learn more about server side programming with JS.</p>

    <h1 id="experienceHeading">Experience</h1>
        <p class="myExperience">I graduated from Cal Poly Pomona with a BS in Business Administration in 2011.  Since then I have had several jobs where I was working in departments such as customer service, marketing, and administration.  I did not find meaning or any real importance in the work I was doing which seemed to always lead me to leaving and finding something else. I am hoping that with this career change into web development and the ability to create things that people will see and use I will find more meaning and importance in the work I do (I would also like to be paid a little better :).</p>
