    <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="A picture of Frank Ruiz">
    <p id="about-me-p">Hello may name is Frank and I am an aspiring Web Developer. Back in April 2015 I challenged myself to learn the
        fundamentals of the profession where I used many resources including books, online tutorials, group meet-ups and now
        Learning Fuze! My goal is to gain employment in the field with an organization that would allow me to hone my
        skills. In addition I plan to use these skills in order to test any business ventures/ideas that I may have in the
        future.
